# ClubHoloHub — Project Scaffold

**Purpose:** A full-stack, deployable platform to showcase club members, events, and interactive "holographic flipping cards", with AI-driven personalization, real-time chat, and production-grade deployment assets.

This scaffold contains:
- `backend/` — FastAPI app (JWT auth, Members, Events, basic recommender stub)
- `frontend/` — simple demo page with a 3D holographic card using Three.js
- `deployment/` — Dockerfiles, `docker-compose.yml`, Kubernetes manifests, Jenkinsfile
- `docs/` — architecture, psychology & UI notes, security checklist
- `ml/` — starter ML recommender script
- `schemas/` — DB schema examples for Postgres and MongoDB

You can inspect the scaffold or run locally using Docker Compose (production readiness requires cloud infra and secrets).

## Quick local run (development demo)
1. Install Docker and Docker Compose.
2. From project root:
   ```
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
3. Visit `http://localhost:8080` to view the demo holographic card and API playground at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

## What this scaffold is
- A **learning-ready** prototype showing how pieces fit together (auth, realtime chat, recommender, ML stubs, infra files).
- **Not** a production-ready clone of Netflix; apply further hardening, testing, secrets management, and scaling before public release.

Read `docs/` for architecture, design psychology, and deployment notes.
