# Design & Psychology — How to delight users

## Human mental models and UX patterns
- **Immediate feedback**: Users expect instant reaction to actions (likes, joins). Use micro-interactions.
- **Variable reward**: Like social feeds (Instagram), intermittent novelty increases engagement. Recommender models should inject novelty vs familiarity balance.
- **Cognitive load reduction**: Present one main action per screen. Use progressive disclosure for advanced options.
- **Social proof**: Show counts, endorsements, featured achievements to increase credibility.
- **Scarcity & FOMO**: 'Limited seats' tags for events increases sign-ups.
- **Onboarding funnel**: Lightweight onboarding; collect minimal data first, then progressively profile the user.
- **Privacy controls**: Let users control visibility of achievements — this builds trust.

## Holographic card UX specifics
- Keep motion subtle: fast flipping or rotation can cause motion sickness.
- Use affordances: shadow + perspective + highlight to suggest 3D.
- Provide fallback static card for low-powered devices.

## Accessibility
- Keyboard focus order, ARIA labels, high contrast mode, and reduced motion preference.

## Retention & Growth ideas
- Gamify: badges for event participation.
- Referral flows with incentives.
- Exportable achievement certificates (PDF).
- Club leaderboards with privacy toggles.
