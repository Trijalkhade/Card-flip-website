# Architecture Overview — ClubHoloHub

## High-level components
- **Frontend (SPA)**: React or Next.js + TailwindCSS; served via CDN / Nginx.
- **Backend API**: FastAPI (Python) with JWT auth, REST + GraphQL optional, Socket.IO for realtime chat.
- **Datastores**:
  - PostgreSQL: relational data (users, members, events, achievements).
  - MongoDB: flexible storage for chat messages, activity logs, user metadata.
  - Redis: caching, session store, rate-limiting.
  - Elasticsearch (optional): search, suggestions, trending events.
- **ML Services**:
  - Recommendation microservice (PyTorch/TensorFlow or scikit-learn prototype).
  - Feature store + offline training pipelines.
  - Online inference via REST/gRPC or model server (TorchServe/Triton).
- **Realtime**:
  - Socket.IO (or native WebSockets) behind an ASGI server (Uvicorn + Gunicorn workers).
- **Infra & DevOps**:
  - Containerization: Docker + multi-stage builds.
  - Orchestration: Kubernetes (EKS/GKE/AKS).
  - CI/CD: Jenkinsfile and GitHub Actions examples.
  - Observability: Prometheus + Grafana, ELK (Elasticsearch/Logstash/Kibana).
  - Secrets: Vault/AWS Secrets Manager.
  - CDN/Storage: AWS S3 + CloudFront.
- **Security**:
  - JWT with rotation, refresh tokens stored in Redis (httpOnly cookies).
  - Parameterized SQL (SQLAlchemy), input validation (Pydantic).
  - Rate limiters, WAF, TLS with cert-manager / Let's Encrypt.
  - Static analysis, SAST, dependency scanning.

## Microservice layout (suggested)
- auth-service
- user-service (profiles, achievements)
- event-service (events & scheduling)
- chat-service (socket clusters, redis pub/sub)
- recommender-service (model inference)
- frontend (static hosting)
- gateway (NGINX / API Gateway / Traefik)

## Dataflow (user story)
1. User signs up → auth-service (email verification).
2. User interacts with event/reel → frontend logs interactions (clicks, dwell time).
3. Interaction event forwarded to event pipeline (Kafka) → stored to analytics store.
4. Recommender microservice consumes aggregated signals → updates user embeddings → serves personalized feed.
